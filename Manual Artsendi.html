        <strong>Potrait</strong><br>
This is a Grade 10 assignment where we were asked to create a facial sketch and then 
color it to resemble a chosen character. The character could be freely selected, and I chose 
Wednesday Addams, portrayed by Jenna Ortega. The art style was also flexible, allowing options such as
 realism, anime, sketch, or other styles.

        <strong>Anatomy of Typography</strong><br>
        This assignment focuses on applying the anatomy of typography from a specific font. We analyzed elements such as the crossbar, whether the font is sans serif or not, kerning, ascenders, and other typographic details accurately, so that when it was created on paper, the result looked neat and well-organized.

        <strong>Making Font</strong><br>
        In this project, we created a custom font designed to visually represent the style and meaning of a word. For example, I chose the word “Ramen,” and the font was decorated with ramen-inspired elements, where the ornaments and even the letterforms themselves were transformed to resemble ramen.

        <strong>Still Life</strong><br>
        In this project, I studied realistic sketching and coloring techniques using a realistic photo reference. After that, the sketch was drawn in a drawing book and carefully colored to achieve a realistic result that closely matches the reference photo.
